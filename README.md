# Biblion

## Biblion is a modern web page for a Book Store.

In this project I wanted to create a good looking web page showing my skills in web design as well as my skills to translate the design to code.
I wanted to create a black and gold/white page to change the normal light background that is used on most web pages.

## Technologies

```
HTML
SASS
JavaScript
```

## What is comming next with this project?

I'm going to implement a Book API to fetch data from it and display the information of the books, also wanna add a filter using the search input on top and lastly, I'm going to add the feature of adding the books to the cart when the user clicks on Add To Cart button.
